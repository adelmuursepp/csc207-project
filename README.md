## Problem domain & high-level description
We are focusing on creating an application in **health care** problem domain. We are thinking of making the user experience of analyzing symptoms and diagnosis more user-friendly and interactive. Some of the options for that could be gathering information about the user regarding their age, gender, symptoms. Potentially, some computer vision could be implemented for diagnosis if a relevant API is found.
