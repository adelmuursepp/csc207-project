# Project for CSC207 course - Fall 2023

## TODO
- Add a screenshot about using a tool like Hoppscotch for API calls, some more ideas for APIs or changing project description

## Team members 
Daniel Shi, Nivadhini, Parsh, Adel Muursepp

## Problem domain & high-level description
We are focusing on creating an application in **health care** problem domain. We are thinking of making the user experience of analyzing symptoms and diagnosis more user-friendly and interactive. Some of the options for that could be gathering information about the user regarding their age, gender, symptoms. Potentially, some computer vision could be implemented for diagnosis if a relevant API is found.

## Some potential APIs
- [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) that has pre-trained AI models for analyzing images
- [Healthgraphic API](https://www.healthgraphic.com/) is a health content search and discovery API that allows developers to retrieve data about diseases, symptoms and medications.
